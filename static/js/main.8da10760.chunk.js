It can be refined to valuable insight. Data brings its own challenges, especially in large volumes. Data needs to be sourced, transported, transformed, stored, processed, secured, and managed.\n",full:"[% -Data management facets]\n[% -Collection] [% -Sanitation] [% -Diversity] [% -Freshness] Data is essential to all data-driven activities. Data is information, and information can reveal insight. Data fuels all data-driven processes that refine raw data to valuable insight. This is why data is often compared to oil: left untouched their use is limited, but after collection and refinement it has high potential \\cite{spijker2014the}. The inherent properties of big data: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value add new challenges to managing data \\cite{demchenko2013addressing}.\n[% -What data do we need?] In the world of big data and the internet of things, there is an enormous amount of data being generated. The first step is to identify which data has \\textit{relevancy} and must be collected \\cite{labrinidis2012challeng.toString()}. This challenging part is determining beforehand what data will be useful or not. You might want to collect online reviews about your company for sentiment analysis. Do you also collect the reviews about competitors? Depending on the goal of the project you choose what data to collect. You also have to decide which parts of the review you wish to collect. Is the name of the reviewer relevant? Probably not, but the time of placement of the review might hold some insight.\n[% -Where can we obtain the data?] Just like oil, data can be hard to find and extract. Where do you \\textit{source} your data from? Data can reside in legacy systems without easy access, or it can be bought from third-party vendors. Which sources can you trust and are easily accessible?\n[% -How can we use data in-time?] Getting data to your analytics platform can be challenge. You need the right connections and infrastructure to integrate data flows in your systems. More on this in the \\textit{Technology} dimension. An important aspect is the \\textit{timeline.toString()} of the data, especially for automated data-driven processes. Data relevant a week ago may not be relevant today. Data needs to be at the right place at the right time.\n[% -How can we prepare data for analysis?] Not all data is fit for analysis. You may need to combine data with other sources or \\textit{transform} it to a more suitable form. You need to decide when, and how, you would want to do this. It might be more efficient to prepare the data after extraction, rather than to do it when you start the analysis later on. Data is often transformed beforehand so that it will be easier to perform analyses on it afterward, such as the case in \\textit{online analytical processing (OLAP)} \\cite{chaudhuri1997an}.\n[% -How can we govern the data?] [% -Quality] [% -Usability] [% -Accessibility] [% -Ownership] Data is an asset, and all assets need to be managed. To govern all these aspects of data, it is important to establish responsibility for data assets. \\textit{Data Governance} concerns itself with the management of data during its life-cycle \\cite{khatri2010designing}. Many different governance strategies exist, depending on the size of the organization and the volume of data, some may be better suited than others. Some overlapping concerns are data quality, data access, and data life-cycle management.\n[% -How can we ensure the quality of the data?] Ensuring data \\textit{quality} is a challenge that is getting more relevant in the age of big data. More data, from an increasing variety of sources, means the data you collect is more liable to containing errors. If the quality of the data becomes too impure, the decisions you make based on that data will become flawed. Processes should be in place to monitor and improve the quality of the data you use for analytics.\n[% -How can we secure data and keep privacy in mind?] Data \\textit{security} & \\textit{privacy} are two related concepts that can easily be overlooked by new practitioners. The classic way of thinking is that investments in security and privacy are not directly value-adding and are therefore often postponed until it is too late. But losing data or compromising customer privacy is a great financial risk, and mitigating this risk should be a primary concern when managing data. Strict authorization and access control should be in place. User privacy is also no longer an afterthought. Users value their privacy and organizations should act in a responsible matter in order to not breach the users' trust. New legislation, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, also force organizations to comply with standards regarding privacy and data protection \\cite{albrecht2016how}.\n\n\n\n \n"}},166:function(e){e.exports={name:"Metrics",short:"Where Data is concerned with the right input, Metrics are about measuring the output. Being data-driven is creating a fast feedback cycle between input and output. The sooner you know what the effect of your changes is, the sooner you know if you are doing the right things. Metrics form the foundation of a continuously learning and improving organization. Metrics backed by analytical models can help you steer into the right direction faster and more accurately.\n",full:"If data is about the input, metrics are about measuring the output. You can measure the specific performance of a process or track more global key performance indicators (KPI's) \\cite{neely1995performance}. \n[% Set priorities] Determining which indicators are key sets the priorities of the organization. KPI's should reflect the objectives of the business strategy. If you are are aiming for growth you might track total sales per time period, but if you are trying to optimize the digital advertising budget you can look at the return on advertising spend (ROAS).\n[% Current performance] Metrics should also be used to monitor the organization. Data-driven organizations enable managers to view real-time metrics, which can be used to steer and correct. Timely feedback is important. A real-time dashboard allows managers to quickly identify trends. Trends can be both negative in which case they can be corrected or opportunities which can be seized.\n[% Track and stimulate progression] Metrics form the core of the performance management program. They communicate the priorities of the organization and prevent a focus on trivial tasks. Management should be aware of the side effects of a hard focus on metrics and targets. The amount of sales as the most important measurement of performance might incentivize the usage of aggressive promotions `to meet the targets'. This behavior can hurt profitability in the long-term. Especially when performance bonuses are tied to flawed KPI's.\n \n[% Gathering metrics] Collecting some metrics can be a challenge. Some straightforward financial metrics, such as turnover or profit, are usually easy to measure. Some more advanced metrics, such as customer lifetime value (CLV), the prediction of how much profit a customer is going to generate for the entire future, are very hard to correctly derive, and depend very much on the type of business. Deriving meaningful metrics can be a challenge, but the right metrics can greatly impact company performance.\n"}},167:function(e){e.exports={name:"Skills",short:"The people in the organization are responsible for the success of a data-driven transformation. Do they have the right skill set to enable this? We can distinguish between the analytical and general skills necessary. The analytical skills are the data science techniques and knowledge necessary to create actionable insight from raw data. The general skills are the data literacy skills all employees should have. Can they read charts and understand statistics? Do they know how to run experiments?\n",full:"[% -People] [% -Analytical techniques] [% -Training] [% -Shortage of analytical talent] [% -Work with tools] [% -Business sense]\nThe people in the organization and the analytical skills they have form a vital part of the analytical process. Talent needs to be developed, managed, and attracted. Data does not work on its own, it needs to be put to work by people with data science and analytics skills. Many organizations starting analytics efforts do not have the necessary skills, and as a result struggle to get the most value out of their data.\nData science is the set of principles and techniques that guide the extraction of information and knowledge from data \\cite{provost2013data}. Principles and techniques draw from statistics and computer science such as data mining and machine learning. These fundamental skills have to combined with visualization skills to communicate with other parts of the business. Finally a data scientist needs to be able to ``view business problems from a data perspective'' \\cite{provost2013data}. \nDepending on their background employees can follow training for analytical skills but it is a hard subject to get into without an analytical background or education. Formal education is often required for areas such as big data and machine learning. Therefore it is important to attract and retain people with the right set of skills. Attracting talent is a challenge because the demand for data science skills is rapidly growing, which puts pressure on the demand \\cite{miller2017the}. \nData literacy is a basic understanding of what data means and can do, including interpreting statistics and drawing conclusions from data \\cite{carlson2011determining}. Data literacy consists of a set of skills which are beneficial to have for all employees, not only those in a analytics department. Everyone should have the ability to correctly interpret results or dashboards made by the analytics department. Data literacy across the organization can be increased by training and hiring people with analytical backgrounds.\nA broad range of specific analytical techniques are available with different levels of sophistication and different applications. Based on the goals of the organization different techniques can be used. Very advanced techniques such as deep learning require very specific knowledge about the subject and may require people with specific backgrounds. The required knowledge can be very specific to the domain and organization.\n"}},168:function(e){e.exports={name:"Technology",short:"If Data is the fuel, Technology is the catalyst for data-driven activities. Technology plays a role in every step of the analytical process. Advanced systems allow easy integration of analytically produced insight in business processes. \n",full:"[% -Tools] [% -Infrastructure]\n[% -Buy or build] [% --budget] [% --skills] [% --speed] [% --agility]\n[% -Collecting] [% -Extracting] [% -Storing] [% -Analyzing] [% -Integrating] [% -Visualizing] [% -Connecting]\n[% -Buy or Build] If Data is the fuel, Technology is the catalyst for data-driven activities. Technology plays a role in every step of the analytics process. Different technologies are used to generate, store, and process data. We can identify 7 different main areas for technology related to data-driven processes: Collecting, Extracting, Storing, Analyzing, Visualizing, Integrating, and Connecting.  There are often many different technologies or products that solve the same problems, albeit in a slightly different way. For every problem you have to decide which technology is going to be used. Do you build it yourself? Is there a product on the market that solves our problem within our budget? There is no silver bullet. Depending on your needs and available resources, both money and skills, you will have to decide what the best solution is.\n\\subsubsection{Collecting} Data is either not being generated yet or residing somewhere you cannot perform analytical processing. For example you want to better understand user behavior on your website, but you have no tracking implementation yet. You would first need to use the technology to collect data. There are many (free) web analytics solutions, so it does not make a lot of sense to build a solution yourself.\n\\subsubsection{Extracting} Other times the data is already there, for example customer and order data in a CRM system. You still have to extract data from the system to a platform where you can analyze the data. You have to build or use existing connectors to extract the data. You might also need to transform or cleanse data before it is useful for analysis. \n\\subsubsection{Storing} The big data revolution gives us enormous amounts of data at our disposal. Storage capacity is continuing to grow while also getting cheaper. You can store data in many ways. You could build big archives in flat files and store them on disks. But in this scenario it would be very hard to analyze or search in this data. For analytical purposes we want to store the data in a database or data store, which provides easier and faster access than the standard file system. Many different database solutions exist that all have different features and specialties. Picking a database solution is often a trade-off.  For analyzing it is important to be able to store large amounts of data and having a high throughput to be able to process it all.  For example Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) \\cite{borthakur2008hd.toString()} is a distributed data store for storing and processing big data on commodity hardware. An implementation of MapReduce \\cite{dean2008mapreduce} then allows parallel processing of big data sets.\n\\subsubsection{Analyzing} When the data is stored somewhere easily accessible you can start to analyze it.  There are many tools and techniques that can be used to analyze data. There are many solutions to explore or mine data for insight. Open source machine learning solutions, such as WEKA \\cite{hall2009the}, can be used to mine for insight and to create analytical models that can be used to make predictions. In other scenarios it might be better to create and apply machine learning algorithms yourself.\n\\subsubsection{Visualizing} Visualizing data is an important component of analytics. Presenting data and metrics to those making the decisions allows them to base the decisions on data, instead of intuition.  The easier the data is to understand, the easier it is to make decisions based on the data. Many solutions and services exist to visualize the data by making dashboards, charts, and more. New tools, with simplified user interfaces, allow end-users to create their own dashboards with the available data. These new tools allow the business side to become more self-reliant and flexible. The challenge is to get the right data to the right users at the right time, allowing users to make the best decisions at the right moment.\n\\subsubsection{Integrating} The automatic integration of insight into your business processes allows you to capture the maximum value of your analytics efforts on a big data scale. Machine learning capabilities, like automatically recommending products, provide a tremendous amount of value. Automation means you can make decisions on a micro-scale. For a customer facing company this can mean personalizing interactions for small segments or individual customers.  Integrating is a technical challenge with two major challenges. The first challenge is to connect analytics environments with production environments. Data goes in the analytics environment and insight flows out. This insight has to be available in production environments to be utilized in customer interactions. The other challenge is the timing. Manual insight retrieval, such as in reports, is often about historic data, e.g. last month. Automated insight integration often requires rapid insight creation and integration. For example, when a customer views a product you might want to update their profile and show new recommended products. This has to happen within seconds. There is no time for grouping data and performing analytics in a big batch.\n\\subsubsection{Connecting} The final area in technology is about bringing all components together.  Connecting everything is a challenge, because you are often working with a large variety in systems. There is also no standard solution or software that is capable of this. In the beginning a lot of systems will be connected manually, by extracting and importing data, or by batch processes. For our big data and integrated analytics needs this process will need to be faster with a greater capacity. This makes the data pipeline a central component to the data-driven organization. Instead of looking to connect two systems we might look at a central data flow where systems can plug into. A central nervous system of the organization with different components reacting to events.\n"}},169:function(e){e.exports={name:"Leadership",short:"Leadership has an important role in the early stages of data-driven maturity.

The leader of a business unit, with a strong passion for data-driven decision-making, can provide the ideal starting point for building analytical capabilities. Leadership is responsible for allocating the necessary resources for building an analytics team.\nThe next task is to continue encouraging the data-driven way of operating, both to other leaders as to employees. Upper management has the best chance of changing the orientation of the company toward a focus on data \\cite{davenport2017competing}. They have an important role in communicating results to other leaders, in order to convince them of the merits of analytics.\n[% passionate] [% act on results] Several characteristics make a successful analytical leader. Analytical leaders have a passion for using data and analytics in order to drive business success, which they use to inspire the organization \\cite{davenport2017competing}.

Analytical culture stretches beyond the analytics department. Some companies such as Google or Amazon are based on analytics, and therefore have nurtured an analytical culture from the beginning. Management in other companies may be more traditional, and rely on their intuition more. There are two main challenges in creating an analytical culture.\nThe first challenge is the acceptance of data-driven decision-making. Many companies are used to base decisions on intuition and personal knowledge, with the highest manager having the final say. Analytics provides a solution backed by data, but this solution is worthless if it is dismissed by management. Management can have a number of reasons to ignore the findings. They may not trust the analysts or their methodology. This is often fueled by insufficient knowledge about data science. That is why data literacy is important for everyone in the organization. Leadership is important to set the right example to other levels of management and to promote the acceptance of data-driven decision-making.\nThe second challenge is to engage and empower all employees to adopt a data-driven way of thinking and operating.

Every company is different and has different competitive advantages. For an e-commerce company, selling to thousands of customers everyday, it makes sense to use prescriptive analytics to implement a recommender system, while for another company, selling expensive devices to a couple of businesses per month, it would make no sense. There are many applications for analytics and many of them will not align with your goals and business model.\nLeadership sets the strategy. The first thing they have to decide is the role of analytics. What are the competitive strengths of the company? How can a data-driven approach sharpen those strengths? What is the long-term vision for analytics in the organization? If you truly want to compete on analytics you have to choose a distinctive analytical capability on which to compete \\cite{davenport2017competing}. This will be different for every company. Some excel through reliable logistics, others predict extremely well what customers are going to prefer. The starting point for your analytics transformation will depend on where you think analytics can make the biggest impact.\nStrategy will transform over time and change with each stage. Early strategy focuses on proving the worth of analytics or beginning to build analytical capabilities. This should be reflected in, for example, the hiring strategy, by hiring data analysts. Strategy should also determine how the organizational structure is going to look like. You might want to start by setting up a team inside department relating to your distinctive capability and grow from there. Medium-term strategy should focus on continuing to build analytical capabilities, training and retaining data analysts, and creating lasting value for the organization. In the long-term analytics has to become a core part of the strategy. It will become a capability you can compete on. Products or services may be introduced that have analytical capabilities as a feature.\n"}},172:function(e){e.exports={name:"Agility",short:"Strategy focuses on the big picture, Agility focuses on how to adapt and execute. Too often a strategic plan fails due to failure to accept change. Analytical transformation requires a massive paradigm shift from intuition-based decision-making to data-driven decision-making.

The plans may be clear and understood, but it is still very easy to slip back into the old ways. New roles and power balances are introduced, which can cause a struggle to adopt the new structures. Agility focuses on implementing the strategy and enabling the program to succeed.\nSuccessful strategic execution is the continuous process of aligning the things you do with the things you should be doing. Many issues can prevent an organization from successfully implementing their strategy. In `The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution' \\cite{neilson2008the} Neilson et al.\\ identified two majors factors for successful strategy execution. The first factor is clarifying decision rights. Clearly defining the roles, and establishing who is responsible for making a specific decision. For our data-driven transformation this is important because the decision-making responsibility may shift from a manager to a data scientist. If the responsibilities are not clearly defined the manager may attempt to keep overruling the data. It may be necessary to develop a change management process to effectively transform the way the organization works.\n"}},173:function(e){e.exports={name:"Integration",short:"Integration is about how the produced insight and results are flowing back to the organization. Integration is about turning data into action. The simplest form is a manually compiled report delivered to a decision-maker. Advanced integration can mean automatically integrating analytical insight into product systems to deliver real-time personalized suggestions to customers.\n",full:"[% -Information management] [% -Automated integration] Integration is a concept that is sometimes overlooked when talking about analytics and data science. Integration in this context is about how the product of analytical efforts is flowing back to the business, and how insight is turned into action. Not every insight can be turned into action by the one doing the analytics. You may need a developer or a manager to implement or utilize the insight.\nWe have manual integration, for example a report delivered to an executive or an opportunity for improvement communicated to a manager. This is often this is the only form of integration. For a team of analysts looking for insight in collected data, or a web analyst looking for website optimizations, there is no automated system integrating the results. Feedback is communicated through reports or presentations, which spur actions that will improve the business. Good manual integration means a process is in place to retrieve and execute on the results of analytics. For example if a web analyst identifies an opportunity for better conversion there should be a process in place to turn this opportunity into action. They should not have to wait indefinitely for implementation. The faster insight is turned into action, the more value is created. Fantastic reports can be created but if there is nobody to read them, or no resources to take action, the analytical efforts will be wasted.\nOrganized manual integration becomes information and knowledge management. Making sure the right information flows back to the stakeholders. A lot of useful information and experience is gained over time, but this information is not often documented. When the organization increasingly starts to run experiments the results have to be documented and easily accessible. \nAutomated integration is the process of automating insight into action. Recommender systems are a good example of automated integration. Customer data is ingested into a recommender system. The system turns the data into insight: products the customer is likely to purchase. This insight flows back to the production systems. The next time a customer views a webpage the recommended products are featured on the page.  Automated integration is the result of a successful combination of analytics and implementation. Automating this process has many challenges. Systems have to be made to make insight available to production systems. Timing is a big challenge. It is one thing to collect and process the data to insight and make a report or spreadsheet. It is much more challenging if this all has to happen in real-time. The whole analytics process has to be automated and fast enough to deliver in-time.\n"}},174:function(e){e.exports={name:"Empowerment",short:"Empowerment is the ability of all employees to engage in analytical activities and reap the benefits.

To put the right tools, techniques, and information in the hands of the workers on the ground so they can discover opportunities and keep progressing. Ensure the flow of information goes where it is needed. One of the goals of a data-driven transformation is to make sure everyone has access to relevant information at the right time.\nA simple example of employee empowerment would be a dashboard available to a manager. It simply displays aggregated data but the manager is able to look at this and identify trends or problems. This puts the power of analytics directly into the hands of the users. A strong analytical culture and widespread data literacy is key to making this successful.  You can also make the data available to the manager. Data sources and visualization tools are available, so a manager can create his own dashboard. Many tools such as Microsoft Power BI \\cite{bi2018interactive} are being developed that allow users to create their own analytics solutions. This is called \\textit{self-service business intelligence} \\cite{imhoff2011selfservice}. The goal is to make the user more self-reliant. They have the best knowledge about what they would want to have available in a dashboard because they have to use it themselves.

New innovation can lead to a business transformation, a fundamental change to how the organization operates. For example, Netflix is known for their strong analytical capabilities, which are used to recommend a user new content. Their prescriptive capabilities have allowed them to build a loyal base of users, because those users were getting personalized recommendations. Now they are taking their analytics one step further, by using the data they collect to create their own content they know will likely succeed.

Data-driven innovation is the greatest source of competitive advantage. A strong analytical foundation, comprised of data, technology, people, and processes, allows an organization to successfully introduce new services, and compete in new markets. This foundation allows an analytical company like Amazon, traditionally an internet company, to confidently enter a new market with the acquisition of Whole Foods. Amazon has the ability to innovate faster, and make decisions based on evidence backed by data analysis \\cite{deloitte2018amazonwhole}. Expanding into new markets can also be a strategic move, to get access to more data and integrate existing services with new markets. Amazon can use their existing customer insight to provide a better service in a new market, while also having the ability to collect more data; both on a individual customer level, as new customers in general. Because of a network effect combining data sources can lead to better individual customer insight. This effect fuels the pursuit of growth in large internet companies \\cite{franklin2009continuo.toString()}. Data-driven principles are universally applicable and can be internally oriented toward business processes and externally toward consumers and markets.
